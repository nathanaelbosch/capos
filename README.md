# Code to accompany the paper: "Calibrated Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers"

This repo contains the code which was used to compute the results of the paper "Calibrated Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers".
We also maintain a Julia package for probabilistic numerial solvers for differential equations,
[ODEFilters.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/ODEFilters.jl),
which contains more features and is under active development.
For a Python implementation of these solvers, as well as of additional probabilistic numerical methods, see also [ProbNum](https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum).
