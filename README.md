# Code for: "Calibrated Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers"

This repo contains the code which was used to compute the results of the paper "Calibrated Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers", currently published in
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08202).


__To solve differential equations in Julia with probabilistic numerical solvers, please use
[ODEFilters.jl](https://github.com/nathanaelbosch/ODEFilters.jl)!__<br />
It is under active development, contains more features, and the DE solvers it provides are compatible with the
[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/stable/)
ecosystem.

A __Python__ implementation of these solvers, as well as of additional probabilistic numerical methods, is maintained in [ProbNum](https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum).
